Data Analysis & Prediction using Python Tools/Machine Learning
This is a CISC 4900 group project which is on Stock Analysis based on three different markets 

**NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR MODELS OR PREDICTION AS A MEANS TO BUY/SELL STOCK. THIS WAS ONLY MEANT FOR A CS RESEARCH COURSE, ANY INVESTMENT MADE IS DONE ON YOUR OWN ACCORD**

Abstract: 

This project focused on how to make a profit in the stock market. A 12-week investment simulation will be conducted analyzing day trading and bonds in different markets. We want to be able to figure out the factors that attribute to the profits from the stock. Through this project, the knowledge learned from this will be used to create leverage for increasing a person's investing power for the future.

Goals: 

The main goal of this project is to investigate investment opportunities while weighing the risks and benefits while making educated investment decisions. A detailed understanding of the risks and the opportunities on high return for each industry. By gaining all this information, this will be used to help make future decisions in making smart investments. 

We want to be able to analyze specific stock markets such as Technology, Airlines, and Healthcare based on the effects of the coronavirus outbreak globally. By retrieving three different kinds of stocks in each market, we will be able to determine how well each stock will end up doing. By analyzing the stock market data with Python (Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.). We will also store the data via MySql which will also help us access the data through jupyter notebook and Pycharm Python IDE, which will also help to generate graphs analyze the behavior of the data.

 Further research is needed in order to complete this step. We also want to be able to implement effective team strategies in order to fully understand processes similar to Scrum.

Python(Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)/Jupyter notebook/PyCharm Machine Learning Machine Learning: Machine learning is part of data science. The word learning in machine learning means that the algorithms depend on some type data that has been used as a training set to fine-tune some model or algorithm parameters. There are many techniques such as regression, naive Bayes or supervised clustering. Machine learning is also involved with statistics to build a model to predict the behavior of data in future. It finds the pattern of the data by using the algorithms of machine learning. By data it can be mean numbers, words, images, clicks or anything we can digitally stored can be used as machine learning data. It has been seen as a subset of Artificial Intelligence which basically builds a mathematical model to predict the data by using a training set. Machine learning has been used everywhere from retail to the financial industry to predict the data set to know what is going to happen in future or how to make it better by getting a prediction. We have tried to use four different types of machine learning algorithms to understand the stock market data we got. We basically want it to see how this model can train the data set we have and implement our data for prediction.

Linear Regression: There are two types of supervised machine learning model one is Regression and another one is classification. Regression predicts continuous value of the output where another one predicts discrete output. For this model we have used scikit-Learn which is one of the most popular machine learning libraries to use it. Scikit-learn has most of the statistical modelling including regression, classification, clustering etc. It has various components such as supervised learning algorithm, unsupervised algorithm and cross validation. In this particular model we have used a supervised algorithm. The spread of machine learning is one of the big reasons to use scikit-learn. We also have used Keras with tensorflow API which is one of the leading high-level neural networks APIs. It is written in Python and supports multiple back-end neural network computation engines. Keras is an open-source neural-network library. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks. Which is widely used in machine learning algorithms.
